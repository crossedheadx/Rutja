# Rutja
Why Rutja? 
Simple: the name come from Arto Paasilinna's "The Son of the Thunder God" which is one of the main characters, 
a funny and light finnish opera easy to read. 
Finnish like Linux's father: Linus Torvalds. 

Is a guide made through these years when I started use Linux every day. Could be a considered a collection of a mini-guides and notes.

:D
